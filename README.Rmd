# walkability_zillowMap

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An application that visualizes the walkability and Zillow listings within an isochrone. Currently designed for the Denver metro.

Run the app with the following. 
<!-- See below for more set up details. -->

```{r,eval=FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub("jzemmels/walkability_zillowMap",subdir = "zillow-walkability")
```

<!-- We assume that you have some R and Python libraries installed on your machine. -->
<!-- The code below will install the required packages. -->

<!-- ```{r,eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- # required R packages -->
<!-- install.packages(c("tidyverse","shiny","shinyWidgets","reticulate","leaflet")) -->

<!-- # required Python libraries -->
<!-- reticulate::py_install(c("httpx","pandas"),pip=TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that you may need to set up Python using the `reticulate` R package. -->
<!-- See <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/> for more information. -->
<!-- The Python dependency is isolated to the Zillow housing data scraping, so you can just not use that functionality if you don't want to worry about Python. -->
